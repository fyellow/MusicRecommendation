# MusicRecommendation
Rapid development of mobile devices and internet has made possible for us to access different music resources freely. The number of songs available exceeds the listening capacity of single individual. People sometimes feel
difficult to choose from millions of songs. Moreover, music service providers need an efficient way to manage songs and help their costumers to discover music by giving quality recommendation. Thus, there is a strong need of a good recommendation system.
In this project, we have designed, implemented and analysed a song recommendation system. We used Rap Artists Dataset provided by BBC Music to find correlations between critics and songs and to learn from the previous listening history of users to provide recommendations for songs which users would prefer to listen most in future.
We have implemented various algorithms such as Item Based Collaborative Filtering and User based Collaborative Filtering model using kNearest Neighbour
